## How to commit a change

1. make sure you're 100% up to date before working by running `git pull upstream`
2. make a **NEW** branch addressing which feature you will be implementing by running `git checkout -b #<issuenumber>` this gives you your own workspace without affecting anyone else working on the project.
3. Implement the feature in your text editor, make sure it's tested and works.
4. run `git add *` to add all the changes
5. `git commit -a "<description of changes>` to commit your changes to your local copy of the git repo
6. `git push origin #<issuenumber>` will push your new branch to the origin repository (on github).
7. Let me know and I'll merge it to the master repo and I can give you a new task.
8. Once you're done and it's merged run `git checkout origin/master` to reset back to the master directory
9. Start from the beginning for the next feature/issue.
